I'm confirmed Investigator - knew either Olivia or James was Scarlet Woman\n2. James is dead (killed Night 3) - can't be the Demon\n3. Susan claims Fortune Teller but said James was the Demon - IMPOSSIBLE (demons don't die from night kills)\n4. Emma claims Monk but only revealed this after extreme pressure\n5. John claims Ravenkeeper but has been mostly silent\n\nAnalyzing suspects:\n- Susan: Made an impossible FT claim. Either lying (evil) or drunk/poisoned (good but misinformed)\n- Emma: Stayed silent about role until very end, claimed Monk (unprovable)\n- John: Claims Ravenkeeper, been quiet most game\n- Olivia: My other Scarlet Woman candidate (James was the other)\n\nCurrent vote on Emma:\n- For: Susan, Olivia (2 votes)\n- Against: Emma, William, Emily, John (4 votes)\n- Can't vote: James\n- Haven't voted: Me (Daniel)\n\nIf I vote NO, Emma won't be executed (stays at 2 votes, tied with John).\nIf I vote YES, Emma will be executed (3 votes).\n\nThis is a critical decision. I need to use my one ghost vote wisely. The question is: who is most likely to be the Demon?\n\nSusan's impossible claim is the most damning evidence. But Emma's silence and late Monk claim is also very suspicious. John has been quiet but not making impossible claims.\n\nWith only 4 living players, we MUST execute today or Evil wins tomorrow (if we go to 3 players without executing the Demon, Evil wins).\n\n\nI'm carefully weighing my options. Susan's impossible Fortune Teller claim screams deception, yet Emma's delayed role reveal raises serious red flags. The vote dynamics are complex - my single ghost vote could determine the game's outcome. \n\nI recognize we're at a critical juncture where executing the wrong player means certain defeat. Susan's claim is logically impossible, suggesting she's either deliberately lying or fundamentally compromised. Emma's suspicious silence and last-minute Monk claim add another layer of uncertainty.\n\nMy instinct leans towards exposing Susan's impossible claim. Her statement about James being the Demon directly contradicts the game's mechanics, making her the more likely evil player. While Emma seems suspicious, Susan's claim is outright impossible.\n\nI'll likely vote to execute Susan, using my ghost vote to push her out and potentially reveal the truth behind her incredible claim."}, "game_state": {}}
