Olivia claimed to be the Chef with 0 adjacent evil pairs.\n5. Susan claimed to be the Soldier.\n6. Emma claimed to have information that Daniel and James are not the Demon.\n\nThe votes so far:\n- William: No (he's defending himself)\n- James: Yes \n- Susan: Yes\n- Emma: Yes\n- Olivia: Yes\n\nThat's 4 YES votes already, which means 4 votes are required to execute and we already have exactly 4. William will be executed.\n\nWait, let me reread... it says \"4 votes have been cast so far\" and \"4 votes are required to execute the nominee\" and then lists 5 votes. Let me count:\n- William: No\n- James: Yes (1)\n- Susan: Yes (2) \n- Emma: Yes (3)\n- Olivia: Yes (4)\n\nSo we have 4 YES votes and 1 NO vote, which means William will be executed since we have the required 4 votes.\n\nBut I still need to vote. The question is whether I should vote YES or NO.\n\nFrom my perspective as a good player:\n- My Washerwoman information was confirmed by James being the Mayor\n- John's Empath information points to William being evil since I know I'm good\n- The logical chain seems sound\n\nHowever, I should consider:\n- Could John be lying and be evil himself?\n- Could John be drunk/poisoned and receiving false information?\n- Could William actually be good?\n\nThe evidence against William is:\n\n\nThe Empath's claim strongly suggests William's evil alignment. His defensive stance when countering John's nomination raises suspicion. Multiple players have found the logical reasoning convincing, which adds weight to the accusation.\n\nI weigh the potential risks carefully. Eliminating a good player would be devastating, and there's a chance John might be manipulating the group. Yet, the evidence appears compelling. My confirmed role and John's Empath reading create a strong case against William.\n\nGiven our team's objective to root out evil players and the substantial evidence, I'll vote YES to execute William."}, "game_state": {}}

So his information is accurate and he's a threat to our team. Getting him executed would be beneficial.\n\nSusan (my Demon teammate) voted YES to execute John, which suggests she also thinks eliminating John is good for our team.\n\nThe vote tally is currently 3 YES, 2 NO.

We have exactly 3 YES votes, so John will be executed regardless of my vote.\n \nI'll strategically vote YES to maintain my cover.

John was nominated by Susan with 3 votes (would be executed unless someone gets more)\n2. Susan was nominated by John - currently 1 vote (John voted YES)\n\nPrevious votes on Susan nomination:\n- Susan: No\n- Emma: Can't vote (used ghost vote)\n- Olivia: No  \n- Daniel: Can't vote (used ghost vote)\n- John: Yes\n- William: Can't vote (used ghost vote)\n- Now it's my turn\n\nKey considerations:\n1. As Mayor, if no execution happens, Good wins immediately with 3 players alive\n2. But John is currently nominated with 3 votes, so he WILL be executed unless Susan gets 4+ votes\n3. If John is executed and he's good, we go to 2 players (Susan + Olivia) and Evil wins\n4. If Susan is executed and she's good, we go to 2 players (John + Olivia) and Evil wins\n\nThe question is: who is the Demon?\n\nEvidence:\n- John has been consistent as Empath, his readings proved accurate about Emma not being Demon\n- Susan claimed Soldier, has been consistent \n- Olivia has been quiet, John's Empath readings suggested she was evil in earlier rounds\n- Emma (Fortune Teller claim) was executed but wasn't Demon since game continued\n- James (me, Mayor) was killed last night\n\nJohn's reasoning for nominating Susan: She could be Spy registering falsely to his Empath ability.\n\nBut wait - if I vote NO on Susan, then Susan stays alive and John gets executed (since he has 3 votes already). If John is actually good Empath, then we lose.\n \nI'm facing a critical voting dilemma. Susan needs 4 total votes to beat John's current 3-vote nomination. With John's YES vote and my potential YES, we'd reach 2 votes. However, Olivia already voted NO, and other players can't vote. This means I can't mathematically save John from execution by voting on Susan's nomination.\n\nMy strategic focus shifts to preventing any execution. If no player gets executed, the Good team wins immediately. But John's nomination seems locked with 3 votes, making his execution almost certain. \n\nThe crucial next step is analyzing the game state after John's potential elimination - specifically determining the remaining players and which team would triumph.\n\nWith Susan and Olivia as the final two, the outcome looks grim for the Good team. Regardless of Susan or Olivia's alignment, Evil appears positioned to win. Each scenario leads to an Evil victory: if Susan is good and Olivia is Demon, or vice versa, the 2-player endgame favors the Evil team.\n\nJohn's consistent Empath performance and Emma identification suggest he's likely good. Susan's steady Soldier claim adds complexity. The decision hinges on preventing an Evil win, but the paths seem increasingly narrow.\n\nMathematically, execution dynamics are constrained. Olivia seems the most probable Demon based on John's earlier readings, yet she isn't even nominated. Between John and Susan, John appears more credible. I'll vote NO on Susan to protect her, understanding this won't alter the final outcome."}, "game_state": {}}
