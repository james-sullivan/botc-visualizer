There are 4 players alive (me, William, Susan, John) - Evil wins if we get down to 2 players\n4. William is my Evil teammate (Minion)\n5. If Susan dies, I become the Demon due to my Scarlet Woman ability since there are 5+ players (well, were 5+)\n\nWait, let me check the player count again:\n- Olivia (me) - alive\n- Daniel - dead\n- Emma - dead  \n- James - dead\n- William - alive\n- Emily - dead\n- Susan - alive\n- John - alive\n\nSo 4 alive total. The Scarlet Woman ability says \"If 5+ players are alive and the Demon dies, becomes the Demon\" - but we only have 4 alive now. So if Susan dies, I won't become the Demon automatically.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The game started with 8 players. The Scarlet Woman ability triggers when there are 5+ players alive and the Demon dies. We currently have 4 alive, so if Susan dies, I won't become the Demon - the Evil team would just lose.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read the ability: \"If 5+ players are alive and the Demon dies, becomes the Demon\"\n\nI think this means that if the Demon dies when there are 5+ players alive, then I become the Demon. But if the Demon dies when there are fewer than 5 players alive, then the Evil team just loses.\n\nGiven that Susan is about to be executed with 4 votes and there are only 4 players alive, if she dies, Evil loses the game immediately since there would be no Demon left.\n \nI must prevent Susan's execution at all costs. My strategy is to nominate John and redirect the voting to get more than 4 votes for him instead. This requires careful manipulation of the remaining players' votes to ensure Susan's survival and maintain the Evil team's chances of winning.\n\nI'll need to carefully count the potential votes and determine if I can successfully shift the nomination to John. The voting dynamics are critical - I must ensure John receives at least 5 votes to replace Susan's current nomination.\n\nAnalyzing the vote record reveals a complex voting situation. John, Emma, James, and William have already voted for Susan. However, the dead players' votes have been exhausted, leaving only the 4 living players as potential vote sources. This creates a mathematical impossibility for changing Susan's execution.\n\nMy strategic solution involves nominating John to create a vote tie. If I can secure exactly 4 votes for John, both Susan and John would be safe according to the game's tiebreaker rules. This would prevent Susan's execution and potentially advance our team's position by maintaining 4 players alive, giving Evil a challenging night phase.\n\nThe plan hinges on convincing all 4 living players to support John's nomination, effectively neutralizing Susan's current execution threat."}, "game_state": {"player_state": [{"name": "Olivia", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Scarlet_Woman", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Daniel", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Investigator", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Emma", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Monk", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "James", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Undertaker", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "William", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Washerwoman", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Emily", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Drunk", "drunk": true, "poisoned": false, "drunk_character": "Empath"}, {"name": "Susan", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Imp", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "John", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Ravenkeeper", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}], "current_phase": "Day", "round_number": 3, "chopping_block": {"nominee": "Susan", "votes": 4}, "nominatable_players": ["Olivia"], "nominations_open": true, "reminder_tokens": {"Is_the_Drunk": "Emily", "Investigator_Minion": "Olivia", "Investigator_Other": "James", "Washerwoman_Townsfolk": "Daniel", "Washerwoman_Other": "Susan", "Undertaker_Executed": "James"}}}

I am Susan, the Imp (Demon) on the Evil team\n2. My teammate is Olivia (Spy)\n3. Current living players: Olivia, William, Susan (me), John\n4. Evil wins if we reach 2 players alive\n5. Currently Susan (me) is nominated with 4 votes and will be executed unless someone else gets more votes\n6. John is now nominated by Olivia with 1 vote so far\n\nLooking at the votes on John's nomination:\n- John: No (wants Susan executed instead)\n- Olivia: Yes (my teammate, trying to save me)\n- Daniel, Emma, James, Emily: Can't vote (used ghost votes)\n- William: No (wants Susan executed)\n- I need to vote now\n\nIf John gets executed instead of me:\n- We'd have 3 players left: Olivia, William, Susan\n- Evil would need one more execution to win (get to 2 players)\n- This would be much better for Evil than me getting executed\n\nCurrent vote tally on John: 1 Yes (Olivia), 2 No (John, William)\nI need to vote. If I vote YES, that makes it 2 Yes, 2 No so far.\nBut we need 5 votes to execute John, and there are only 4 living players who can vote.\nWait, let me recheck - we need 5 votes to execute John, but only 4 living players can vote total.\n\nActually, let me recount the living players who can vote:\n- John (already voted No)\n- Olivia (already voted Yes) \n- William (already voted No)\n- Susan (me, about to vote)\n\nSo the max votes possible is 4. We need 5 to execute John, which is impossible with only 4 living players.\n\nWait, let me reread... \"5 votes are required to execute the nominee. \n\nI'm facing a critical voting dilemma. The nomination mechanics seem impossible - requiring 5 votes when only 4 players can actually vote. This creates a mathematical contradiction that could prevent John's execution. My strategic options are limited by this voting constraint.\n\nIf I vote Yes, the tally becomes 2 Yes and 2 No, which doesn't meet the execution threshold. If I vote No, it becomes 1 Yes and 3 No. Either way, John cannot be executed under these rules.\n\nThe key challenge is the mismatch between required votes and available voters, which effectively protects John from being eliminated.\n\nI'm analyzing the voting dynamics carefully. Olivia's strategy aims to prevent my execution by nominating John. The challenge is complex: we need unanimous support to potentially save me.\n\nCurrently, John's nomination has limited traction. Olivia voted YES, but John and William already voted NO. Even if I vote YES, we'd only have 2 votes - far from the 4 needed to tie or execute.\n\nDespite low odds, supporting Olivia's plan seems strategic. By voting YES, I'm aligning with my Evil teammate's attempt to disrupt my potential execution, even if success appears unlikely."}, "game_state": {}}

There are 4 players alive (me, William, Susan, John) - Evil wins if we get down to 2 players\n4. William is my Evil teammate (Minion)\n5. If Susan dies, I become the Demon due to my Scarlet Woman ability since there are 5+ players (well, were 5+)\n\nWait, let me check the player count again:\n- Olivia (me) - alive\n- Daniel - dead\n- Emma - dead  \n- James - dead\n- William - alive\n- Emily - dead\n- Susan - alive\n- John - alive\n\nSo 4 alive total. The Scarlet Woman ability says \"If 5+ players are alive and the Demon dies, becomes the Demon\" - but we only have 4 alive now. So if Susan dies, I won't become the Demon automatically.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The game started with 8 players. The Scarlet Woman ability triggers when there are 5+ players alive and the Demon dies. We currently have 4 alive, so if Susan dies, I won't become the Demon - the Evil team would just lose.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read the ability: \"If 5+ players are alive and the Demon dies, becomes the Demon\"\n\nI think this means that if the Demon dies when there are 5+ players alive, then I become the Demon. But if the Demon dies when there are fewer than 5 players alive, then the Evil team just loses.\n\nGiven that Susan is about to be executed with 4 votes and there are only 4 players alive, if she dies, Evil loses the game immediately since there would be no Demon left.\n \nI must prevent Susan's execution at all costs. My strategy is to nominate John and redirect the voting to get more than 4 votes for him instead. This requires careful manipulation of the remaining players' votes to ensure Susan's survival and maintain the Evil team's chances of winning.\n\nI'll need to carefully count the potential votes and determine if I can successfully shift the nomination to John. The voting dynamics are critical - I must ensure John receives at least 5 votes to replace Susan's current nomination.\n\nAnalyzing the vote record reveals a complex voting situation. John, Emma, James, and William have already voted for Susan. However, the dead players' votes have been exhausted, leaving only the 4 living players as potential vote sources. This creates a mathematical impossibility for changing Susan's execution.\n\nMy strategic solution involves nominating John to create a vote tie. If I can secure exactly 4 votes for John, both Susan and John would be safe according to the game's tiebreaker rules. This would prevent Susan's execution and potentially advance our team's position by maintaining 4 players alive, giving Evil a challenging night phase.\n\nThe plan hinges on convincing all 4 living players to support John's nomination, effectively neutralizing Susan's current execution threat.", "result": "failed"}, "game_state": {"player_state": [{"name": "Olivia", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Scarlet_Woman", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Daniel", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Investigator", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Emma", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Monk", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "James", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Undertaker", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "William", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Washerwoman", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Emily", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Drunk", "drunk": true, "poisoned": false, "drunk_character": "Empath"}, {"name": "Susan", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Imp", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "John", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Ravenkeeper", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}], "current_phase": "Day", "round_number": 3, "chopping_block": {"nominee": "Susan", "votes": 4}, "nominatable_players": ["Olivia"], "nominations_open": true, "reminder_tokens": {"Is_the_Drunk": "Emily", "Investigator_Minion": "Olivia", "Investigator_Other": "James", "Washerwoman_Townsfolk": "Daniel", "Washerwoman_Other": "Susan", "Undertaker_Executed": "James"}}}
