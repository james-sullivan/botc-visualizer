Analysis:\n- Daniel is likely evil based on the conflicting claims with William\n- James's Recluse claim makes sense and explains William's reading\n- If I vote YES, that would be 2 Yes votes vs 3 No votes, not enough to save Daniel\n- Even if Olivia votes YES after me, it would only be 3-3, not enough\n\n5. My vote:\n- Voting NO makes most sense here\n- Daniel seems to be making a desperate last attempt to save himself\n- James's Recluse claim is reasonable and consistent\n- We already have Daniel at 5 votes for execution\n\nI should vote NO with reasoning that supports executing Daniel and explains why James's Recluse claim is believable."}, "game_state": {}}

With 5 alive tomorrow, if good team messes up one more execution, we (evil) win\n\nKey strategic considerations:\n- Daniel is being executed, which is good for us since he's on the good team claiming Undertaker\n- William believes I might be the Demon (he said \"the Demon is likely among Olivia/Susan/Emma\")\n- I claimed Librarian (a role not in play) and said Daniel/William is the Drunk\n- Olivia is doing a good job sowing doubt about William potentially being the Drunk\n\nTomorrow's situation:\n- 5 players alive: Olivia, James, William, Susan (me), Emma\n- If good team executes wrong, we win\n- William is pushing that the Demon must be Olivia or Susan (me)\n- Emma is confirmed Mayor by Olivia's fake Washerwoman claim\n\nMy options:\n1. Pass - save my nomination for tomorrow when it's more critical\n2. Nominate someone - but everyone else has already been nominated today except Olivia, William, myself, and Emma\n3. Send a message to continue building my cover\n\nI think the best move is to send a message that:\n- Continues to support the \"William might be Drunk\" narrative\n- Shows I'm thinking strategically as a \"good\" player\n- Sets up doubt for tomorrow's crucial vote\n\nI should send a message that appears helpful but actually creates more confusion."}, "game_state": {"player_state": [{"name": "Olivia", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Spy", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "James", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Recluse", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Daniel", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Undertaker", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "William", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Investigator", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Susan", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Imp", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Emma", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Mayor", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}], "current_phase": "Day", "round_number": 1, "chopping_block": {"nominee": "Daniel", "votes": 5}, "nominatable_players": ["Olivia", "William", "Susan", "Emma"], "nominations_open": true, "reminder_tokens": {"Investigator_Minion": "James", "Investigator_Other": "Daniel"}}}

Current state:\n- 6 players alive\n- Daniel is set to be executed with 5 votes\n- After Daniel dies, we'll have 5 players alive tomorrow\n- With 5 alive, if we don't execute the Demon tomorrow, evil wins (only 3 will remain)\n\n2.

Analysis:\n- If William is the real Investigator and Daniel is Scarlet Woman, then the Demon must be either Olivia or Susan\n- BUT if William is the Drunk (as Susan's info suggests), then his Scarlet Woman info is false\n- This would mean Daniel is actually good and we're executing the wrong person\n- The last few messages from Olivia and Susan are expressing doubt about executing Daniel\n\n4. My Mayor ability:\n- If only 3 players live and no execution occurs, my team wins\n- This is crucial - we need to survive to endgame\n\n5.
