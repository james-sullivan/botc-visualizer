The key question is: which execution is more likely to succeed and less likely to expose me?\n\nLooking at the votes so far:\n- James: No (obvious, he's nominated)\n- Daniel: No (defending James)\n- William: Yes (he nominated James)\n\nThat's 1 Yes, 2 No so far. I need to vote, then Olivia votes, then Emma votes.\n\nFor James to be executed, we need 4 total Yes votes. Currently 1 Yes.\n- If I vote Yes, that's 2 Yes\n\n\n- If Olivia votes Yes, that's 3 Yes  \n- If Emma votes Yes, that's 4 Yes = execution\n\nI'll strategically push for James's execution. By voting Yes, I align with my Empath claim and potentially secure our victory. Olivia's support and Emma's potential vote could tip the scales. This approach maintains my cover while advancing our evil team's objective of winning the game."}, "game_state": {}}

Current voting order and votes:\n   - James: No (he's the nominee, claims he's Good)\n   - Daniel: No (claims William is lying about my character)\n   - William: Yes (nominated James, says his Investigator info points to James as Scarlet Woman)\n   - Susan: Yes (agrees with William's reasoning)\n   - Now it's my turn to vote\n\n2. Key information:\n   - I'm the Mayor, not the Saint as Daniel claimed\n   - This proves Daniel's Undertaker information about me is false\n   - Since Daniel's information about me being Saint is wrong, we can't trust his other claims\n   - William claims to be Investigator and says James or Daniel is Scarlet Woman\n   - James claims to be Recluse (which could explain registering as Evil)\n\n3. Current vote count:\n   - James has 2 YES votes (William, Susan)\n   - Need 4 votes total to execute James\n   - Need 3 votes to tie with William (who currently has 3 votes and is set to be executed)\n\n4. Strategic considerations:\n   - If James gets 3 votes, he ties with William and neither gets executed\n   - If James gets 4+ votes, he gets executed instead of William\n   - I'm a ghost with only one vote for the entire game - should I use it now?\n\n5. Analysis of who might be Evil:\n   - Daniel's Undertaker claim is proven false by his wrong information about me\n   - William's Investigator claim could be true, pointing to James as Scarlet Woman\n   - James claims Recluse but this could be a convenient cover\n   - Susan supported my execution Day 1 based on her Empath claim\n\nGiven that Daniel's information is proven false, and William's Investigator claim remains uncontradicted, James seems like a reasonable target. However, as a ghost, I should probably save my vote for a more critical moment unless this is truly the deciding vote.\n\n\nI'm carefully tracking the vote dynamics. James needs two more votes to be executed, which means Olivia's vote becomes crucial. If I vote YES, James would still need Olivia's support to reach execution. The strategic complexity lies in potentially creating a tie that prevents William's execution while potentially exposing James as Evil.\n\nThe critical decision hinges on whether preventing William's execution is more important than potentially executing James. With only four players remaining, eliminating an Evil player becomes paramount to survival. I must weigh the risk of letting a potential Scarlet Woman remain in the game against the opportunity to block William's execution."}, "game_state": {}}
