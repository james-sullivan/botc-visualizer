I could:\n\n1. Send a general message to everyone asking for information\n2. Send private messages to a few players to start building trust\n3.

Let me analyze the current situation:\n\nFrom the game history, I can see that:\n1. I'm Daniel, the Poisoner on the Evil team\n2. Susan is the Demon and Olivia is the other Minion\n3. Michael (who was the Empath) died at the end of Day 1 due to the Virgin power\n4.

However, this could be a very important decision if Daniel is indeed the Demon.\n\nWith 8 players alive and Evil needing only 2 players left to win, we're getting close to endgame. If Daniel is the Demon, executing him wins the game for Good. If Daniel is just a Minion, we still remove an evil player but don't win yet.\n\nGiven that:\n- My Empath info is reliable \n- The logic pointing to Daniel makes sense\n- We're in a critical phase of the game\n- This nomination has strong reasoning behind it\n\nI think I should vote YES. This is likely one of the most important votes of the game, and the evidence strongly points to Daniel being evil (and possibly the Demon)."}, "game_state": {}}

William claimed Fortune Teller and said he ruled out Emma as Demon, pointing to Daniel.\n\nDaniel was nominated and executed with overwhelming votes.\n\nRound 3: Now David died at night.\n\nCurrent alive: Emma, Emily, William, Susan, Olivia, John (6 players)\n\nKey insights:\n- Daniel was executed but the game continues, so Daniel was NOT the Demon\n- This means either William's Fortune Teller claims were false, or someone else is the Demon\n- Susan's false Investigator info still makes her suspicious\n- Michael's real Empath info said 1 of Daniel/Emma was evil - if Daniel wasn't the Demon, then Emma might be evil (but not necessarily the Demon)\n- We're down to 6 players, Evil needs to get to 2 to win\n\nAs Mayor, if we get to 3 players and no execution occurs, Good wins.

I'm John, the Mayor, on the Good team\n2. There are currently 6 players alive: Emma, Emily, William, Susan, Olivia, John\n3.

Emma is about to be executed.\n\nNow, is Emma actually evil? Let me think about this:\n- Michael's Empath reading was \"1 of Daniel/Emma is evil\"\n- I (Daniel) was the evil Poisoner, so Michael's reading was correct - I was the evil one\n- Emma is actually Good\n\nSo Emma is Good, and my Evil teammates Susan and Olivia are voting YES to execute a Good player, which helps our team win! This is perfect.\n\nAs a dead Evil player, should I vote YES or NO?\n- Voting YES helps execute a Good player (Emma), which brings us closer to the 2-player win condition\n- We currently have 6 players alive (Emma, Emily, William, Susan, Olivia, John)\n- If Emma is executed, we'll have 5 alive\n- Susan (Demon) is still alive, which is what we need to win\n\nSince Emma is Good and my Evil teammates are voting YES to execute her, I should also vote YES to help secure this execution. This brings us closer to victory.\n\nFor my public reasoning, I need to maintain the facade and agree with the \"mathematical logic\" everyone is using, while my private reasoning can acknowledge this helps the Evil team."}, "game_state": {}}

The logic was that if Michael (confirmed real Empath) said 1 of Daniel/Emma is evil, and Daniel wasn't the Demon, then Emma must be evil.\n\nRound 4 Night: William died at night.\n\nSo now we have Emily, Susan, Olivia, and John alive (4 players).\n\nKey information:\n- Emma was executed but the game continued, so Emma was NOT the Demon\n- William died at night, so likely killed by the Demon\n- We're down to 4 players: Emily, Susan, Olivia, John\n- Evil wins when there are only 2 players left alive\n- As Mayor, if we get to 3 players and no execution occurs, Good team wins\n\nThis means:\n- The Demon is still alive among Emily, Susan, or Olivia\n- Susan is still suspicious due to false Investigator claim\n- Michael's Empath info was about evil MINIONS, not the Demon - both Daniel and Emma were likely evil Minions\n- We need to find the real Demon quickly before we hit 2 players\n\nStrategy:\n- We're at 4 players, evil needs 2 more deaths to win\n- If we mislynch today and Demon kills tonight, it's game over (2 players left)\n- As Mayor, if we reach 3 players with no execution, Good wins\n- Need to identify the Demon among Emily, Susan, Olivia\n- Susan remains most suspicious due to false Investigator claim"}, "game_state": {"player_state": [{"name": "Daniel", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Poisoner", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Michael", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Empath", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Emma", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Ravenkeeper", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "James", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Undertaker", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "David", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Washerwoman", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Emily", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Virgin", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "William", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Fortuneteller", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Susan", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Imp", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Olivia", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Spy", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "John", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Mayor", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}], "current_phase": "Night", "round_number": 4, "chopping_block": null, "nominatable_players": ["Emily", "Susan", "Olivia", "John"], "nominations_open": true, "reminder_tokens": {"Fortuneteller_Red_Herring": "James", "Washerwoman_Townsfolk": "Michael", "Washerwoman_Other": "Olivia", "Virgin_Power_Used": "Emily", "Imp_Killed": "William"}}}

There are 4 players alive: Emily, Susan, Olivia, John\n2. I'm a ghost (executed on round 1) with Empath ability\n3. My Empath info said 1 of Daniel/Emma was evil, but both were executed and neither was the Demon - so I was likely drunk/poisoned from the start\n4.

Her nomination of John feels like a desperate attempt to avoid execution\n\nJohn's Mayor claim, while convenient, doesn't have the same concrete evidence against it that Susan's false Investigator claim provides.\n\nAs a dead Ravenkeeper, I should probably save my ghost vote for the most critical moment.

I'm Mayor - if we reach 3 players with no execution, Good wins\n2. Susan's Investigator claim was that Emily/John was Poisoner, but Emily is confirmed Virgin\n3. Even if Susan was poisoned, real Investigators get accurate info about Virgins\n4. We're at 4 players - if Evil gets us down to 2 players, they win automatically\n5.

I should vote YES to execute her.\n\nWait, let me double check the vote count needed:\n- 3 votes needed to execute Susan\n- 2 votes needed to tie John (who currently has 2 votes)\n- Susan and Olivia both voted NO, so it's 0 votes for Susan so far\n- I need to vote, then Emily would be the final voter\n\nIf I vote YES and Emily votes YES, that's 2 votes total, which would tie John. But we need 3 votes to actually execute Susan and overtake John's nomination.\n\nSince Susan and Olivia voted NO, and I would vote YES (1 vote), Emily would need to vote YES (2 votes total) to at least tie John. \n\nI'm struggling to understand the exact voting mechanics. With 4 players alive, we need at least 3 votes to execute someone. My current strategy might not work as smoothly as I initially thought. The voting rules seem more complex than a simple majority, and I'll need to carefully consider how to secure Susan's execution.\n\nI realize my initial plan won't succeed. Even if I vote YES and Emily supports me, we can't overcome John's current nomination. The threshold requires more strategic maneuvering, and I'll need to find a way to convince another player to shift their vote.\n\nMy core motivation remains clear: Susan appears to be the most likely Demon. By voting YES, I signal my conviction about her evil alignment and demonstrate strategic alignment with my previous analysis.
