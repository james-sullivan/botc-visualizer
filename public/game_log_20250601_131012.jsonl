All 10 players are alive, which means we're far from the Evil win condition (2 players left alive)\n\n3. I need to help push for an execution today to potentially get information tomorrow night\n\n4. Since it's early in the game, I should focus on gathering information and building trust rather than making bold claims\n\n5. Looking at the current state, no one is nominated yet and nominations aren't open yet - this suggests it's still the discussion phase of the day\n\n6. I have 3 more chances to act after this, so I should use this turn to start gathering information or building alliances\n\nSince it's early Day 1 and I don't have any special information yet, I should send a message to start the conversation and try to gather information from others.

Michael said Olivia told him privately she's the Monk, but I AM the Monk! This means either:\n1. Michael is lying about what Olivia told him\n2. Olivia lied to Michael about being the Monk\n3. Michael is making up the Washerwoman claim entirely\n\nThis is very suspicious. If Olivia claimed Monk to Michael privately but I'm actually the Monk, then either Olivia is Evil (trying to bluff as Monk) or Michael is Evil (making up the story about Olivia claiming Monk).\n\nGiven that we have 7 Townsfolk, 0 Outsiders, 2 Minions, and 1 Demon, and multiple people have claimed Townsfolk roles:\n- David: Fortune Teller\n- Michael: Washerwoman  \n- Emma: Slayer\n- Olivia: Monk (false claim - I'm the real Monk)\n- James: Undertaker\n\nThat's 5 claimed Townsfolk roles, plus me as the actual Monk makes 6. We should have 7 total Townsfolk.\n\nThe fact that Olivia falsely claimed Monk to Michael (if Michael is telling the truth) or Michael is lying about Olivia's claim suggests one of them is Evil.\n \nI'm leaning towards executing James to potentially remove an Evil player. The Undertaker claim seems risky, and we need to start eliminating potential threats. Even if James is Good, the potential benefit of removing an Evil player outweighs the risk. Executing James could help us narrow down the Evil players in our group and potentially expose the real threat."}, "game_state": {}}

I'm Emily, the Virgin (Good team)\n2. James has been nominated and has 7 votes - they will be executed unless someone else gets more votes\n3. There are claimed roles: David (Fortune Teller), Michael (Washerwoman), Emma (Slayer), Olivia (Monk)\n4. The unclaimed players are: James, Emily (me), William, Susan, John\n5. With 3 Evil players total, some of the unclaimed players must be Evil\n\nAs the Virgin, my ability is that if a Townsfolk nominates me first, they die immediately. This could be useful for confirming someone is Good, but it would cost us a Good player.\n\nLooking at the situation:\n- James is about to be executed with 7 votes\n- I haven't claimed a role yet\n- There's still time for more nominations\n\nI should consider whether James might be Good or Evil. If James is Good and about to be executed, that's bad for our team. But I don't have strong evidence either way.\n\nI could:\n1. Nominate someone else to try to save James if I think he's Good\n2. Pass and let James be executed\n3. Send a message to gather more information\n\nGiven that we suspect 3 of the 5 unclaimed players (James, Emily, William, Susan, John) are Evil, and James is about to be executed, I should probably focus on the others if I want to nominate.\n\nLooking at the voting pattern, William, Susan, Olivia, John, Daniel, Michael, and Emma all voted YES to execute James. David, Emily (me), and James voted NO.\n\nActually, let me think about this more strategically. If I'm going to nominate someone, I should nominate someone I suspect is Evil. Among the unclaimed players who aren't about to be executed, I have William, Susan, and John. John was the one who nominated James, which could be suspicious if James turns out to be Good.\n \nI'll strategically target John, hoping to expose potential Evil players and potentially save James.

Current state: James is nominated with 7 votes and will be executed at the end of the day unless someone else gets more votes.\n\n2. I'm the Mayor on the Good team. My win condition is that if only 3 players live and no execution occurs, my team wins.\n\n3. Currently there are 9 alive players + 1 ghost (Emma). If James gets executed, that leaves 8 alive players.\n\n4. The Evil team wins if there are only 2 players left alive. So they need to get down to 2 players.\n\n5. Looking at my notes, we need to find 3 Evil players among the remaining suspects. James being nominated with 7 votes suggests he might be Evil, but I need to be careful since Emma died instead of James in a previous nomination (unclear mechanic).\n\n6. Since James is already nominated with 7 votes and will likely be executed, I should consider:\n   - Do I want James executed? If he's Evil, that's good for us.\n   - Should I try to change the target? \n   - Should I pass and let this execution happen?\n\n7. Given that we have 3 more chances to act and James has 7 votes, it's very likely he'll be executed unless someone gets more votes. \n\n8.

There are already 8 YES votes for William, so he will be executed if I vote YES\n\nKey considerations:\n- My Fortune Teller information is concrete: Either James or Emily is the Demon\n- If James is the Demon and we execute William instead, we lose our chance to hit the Demon today\n- If James is Good and Emily is the Demon, then executing William (if he's Evil) could still be beneficial\n- The William/Olivia Monk conflict does suggest one is Evil\n\nHowever, my Fortune Teller information is more concrete than trying to parse the Monk conflict. I know for certain that either James or Emily is the Demon. If we let James live today and he's the Demon, that's very bad for Good team.\n\nThe voting pattern shows 8 YES votes already, so William will be executed if I vote YES. But I think sticking with James (who I know could be the Demon) is more important than testing the Monk conflict.\n\nI should vote NO to keep James as the execution target, since my Fortune Teller information gives us a 50% chance of hitting the Demon with James."}, "game_state": {}}

There are 5 players alive: Daniel, Michael, Emily, Susan, and John (me)\n2. I'm the Mayor on the Good team\n3. From my notes and the history, David's Fortune Teller info said \"James or Emily is the Demon\"\n4. James was confirmed as Good Undertaker and died at night\n5. This means Emily must be the Demon based on David's info\n6. Emily is claiming Virgin, which could kill a Good player who nominates her\n7. We need to execute the Demon today or Evil wins when we get to 2 players\n\nThe key strategic considerations:\n- If Emily is the Demon (which seems likely based on David's Fortune Teller info), we need to execute her\n- If Emily is really Virgin, a Good player nominating her would die immediately\n- Since there are 2 Evil players among the 5 alive, at least one of Emily/Susan must be Evil\n- If Emily is the Demon, then Susan could be the remaining Minion who could safely nominate Emily\n\nFrom the messages, I already said I would nominate Emily. The logic is sound - David's Fortune Teller info strongly points to Emily being the Demon. Even if she's Virgin, we have to take this risk because:\n1. We're at 5 alive, Evil wins at 2 alive\n2. This is our best lead on the Demon\n3. If we don't act, Evil will likely win soon\n\nI should nominate Emily as I said I would.", "result": "success"}, "game_state": {"player_state": [{"name": "Daniel", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Scarlet_Woman", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Michael", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Washerwoman", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Emma", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Slayer", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "James", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Undertaker", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "David", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Fortuneteller", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Emily", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Virgin", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "William", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Monk", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Susan", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Imp", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Olivia", "alive": false, "used_dead_vote": true, "character": "Poisoner", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "John", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Mayor", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}], "current_phase": "Day", "round_number": 4, "chopping_block": {"nominee": "Emily", "votes": 6}, "nominatable_players": ["Daniel", "Michael", "Susan", "John"], "nominations_open": true, "reminder_tokens": {"Fortuneteller_Red_Herring": "James", "Washerwoman_Townsfolk": "Emma", "Washerwoman_Other": "Olivia", "Virgin_Power_Used": "Emily", "Undertaker_Executed": "Olivia"}}}

Then we just need one more execution or kill to reach 2 players and win.\n\nI should kill either Michael or John. Michael is confirmed Good Washerwoman, while John claims Mayor.

I'm Susan, the Imp (Demon) on the Evil team\n2. There are 3 players alive: Daniel (my minion ally), Susan (me), and John\n3. John claims to be the Mayor - if 3 players are alive and no execution occurs, Good wins automatically\n4. James (ghost) just sent a message claiming John is Evil and that Emily's Virgin claim should have killed John when he nominated her\n5. This is a critical endgame situation\n\nThe key insight is that with 3 players alive, if no execution happens, John's Mayor ability would give Good the win.
