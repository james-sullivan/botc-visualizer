Emily claims Empath, says both neighbors (William & Susan) are evil\n5. Susan claims Fortune Teller\n\nAnalysis:\n- Emily's claim that 2/2 neighbors are evil is problematic - with only 1 Minion and 1 Demon, this seems unlikely unless there's a Spy registering as evil\n- William's information correctly identified me as Investigator, supporting his claim\n- Olivia's false claim about me being Chef + my info that she or James is Scarlet_Woman makes Olivia very suspicious\n- Susan's Fortune Teller claim doesn't directly contradict anyone\n\nThe fact that Emily suddenly claimed Empath with 2/2 evil neighbors right when William was about to be nominated seems very suspicious. This could be:\n1. Emily is evil trying to save Olivia by redirecting to William/Susan\n2. Emily is drunk/poisoned and getting false info\n3. Emily is telling the truth (unlikely with only 2 evil total)\n\nI should vote NO on Susan because:\n- William is already going to be executed with 6 votes\n- We should see what happens with William's execution first\n- Emily's claim seems false or she's compromised\n- Executing based on likely false information is bad\n\nI need to vote NO and explain that we should stick with William's execution first."}, "game_state": {}}

Current execution nominee: Emily with 6 votes\n2. Susan is nominating John, claiming he duplicated her Fortune Teller claim\n3. John claims to be Fortune Teller, checking William/Emily night 1 and seeing one demon\n4. Susan also claims Fortune Teller\n\nMy information:\n- I'm Investigator - learned Olivia or James is Scarlet_Woman\n- James claims Undertaker and says William was Washerwoman\n- This would make Olivia the Scarlet Woman (since James seems good)\n- Emily claimed impossible 2/2 evil neighbors\n- We have duplicate Fortune Teller claims (Susan vs John)\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- Emily is already set to be executed with 6 votes\n- We have 7 alive, need 4 votes to execute\n- Current votes on John: John (No), Olivia (No), so 0 YES votes so far\n- Need 6 votes to tie Emily, 7 to overtake\n\nThe question is whether to switch from Emily to John. Given that:\n1. Emily's claim is mathematically impossible (2/2 evil neighbors)\n2. We already have her secured for execution\n3. We can resolve the FT conflict tomorrow\n\nI think we should stick with Emily today and not switch targets. We already have good information that Emily is likely evil (impossible claim), and switching now would waste that. Tomorrow with 6 alive we can properly investigate the Susan vs John conflict.\n\nI should vote NO to keep Emily as the execution target today."}, "game_state": {}}
