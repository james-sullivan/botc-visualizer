William claims to be Fortune Teller and cleared Olivia and me (John)\n\nThe voting so far:\n- William: No (defending himself, says his info is genuine)\n- Emily: No (says Susan's claim has verifiable contradiction)  \n- Susan: Yes (says William is too convenient)\n\nAs the Virgin, I need to be very careful about who nominates me, because if a Townsfolk nominates me, they die immediately. This is a powerful ability but I need to use it strategically.\n\nLooking at the core issue: James says he knows he's not the Drunk, which directly contradicts Susan's Librarian claim. If James is telling the truth about his own character, then Susan's information is false, which means either:\n1. Susan is poisoned/drunk and getting false info\n2. Susan is lying about being the Librarian (evil)\n\nWilliam's Fortune Teller claim, while convenient, doesn't have the same direct contradiction. Fortune Teller information could be wrong due to the red herring mechanic or if William is poisoned/drunk.\n\nHowever, the fact that Susan is pushing so hard to execute William when her own claim has a verifiable contradiction seems more suspicious. It feels like deflection.\n\nI think William is more likely to be good here, and Susan is more likely to be evil trying to eliminate a real Fortune Teller. I should vote NO on this nomination."}, "game_state": {}}

If James is the Drunk, he would think he's a Townsfolk character and wouldn't know he's actually the Drunk. So his denial would be expected.\n\n4. However, there's something important to consider: Susan's behavior has been defensive and trying to discredit multiple information sources. She's been deflecting and creating confusion.\n\n5. Looking at the voting pattern:\n- Susan voted No (defending herself, expected)\n- John voted Yes (finds the contradiction compelling)\n- Olivia voted No (thinks James could be Drunk)\n- Daniel voted Yes (finds Susan suspicious)\n\n6. From my perspective as the Empath, I got information that 0 of my neighbors (Daniel and James) are evil. If this is true, then both Daniel and James are Good. Daniel voting Yes against Susan suggests he believes Susan is evil.\n\n7. James' strong denial and behavior doesn't feel like someone who's confused about their role - it feels like someone who genuinely knows they're not the Drunk.\n\n8. Susan's deflection tactics and attempts to discredit William's Fortune Teller claim while pushing her own contradictory information feels like evil behavior.\n\n9. The votes are currently 2 Yes, 2 No. We need 4 total to execute. My vote could be decisive.\n\nGiven that James seems genuinely convinced he's not the Drunk (and his behavior supports this), Susan's information appears to be false, making her either poisoned (unlikely this early) or lying about being the Librarian.
