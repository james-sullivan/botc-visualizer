I nominated William for execution. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. I nominated William because:\n   - He was evasive for multiple rounds before claiming\n   - He claimed Fortune Teller with info that contradicts my confirmed Empath read\n   - His behavior has been suspicious throughout\n\n2. The votes so far:\n   - 5 votes have been cast (Daniel, Olivia, John, Susan, Emily all voted YES)\n   - William voted NO (as expected since he's nominated)\n   - We already have 5 YES votes, which exceeds the 4 needed for execution\n\n3. As the nominator, I should absolutely vote YES because:\n   - I initiated this nomination\n   - Not voting for my own nomination would send a confusing signal\n   - We already have enough votes to execute, so my YES vote reinforces the decision\n   - William's behavior and contradictory information make him our best execution target\n\nEven if William is just drunk/poisoned rather than evil, executing him helps us:\n- Test whether he's telling the truth\n- Narrow down the pool of suspects\n- Progress the game toward finding the actual evil team\n\nI should vote YES with reasoning that reinforces why I nominated him."}, "game_state": {}}

William is about to be executed with 7 votes - this is good for us as he's the Fortune Teller who could identify Susan as the Demon\n4. The game state shows I can still nominate: \"Players who can currently nominate: Olivia, Daniel, James, Emily, John\"\n5. The players who can be nominated are: Olivia, Emma, Emily, Susan, John\n\nKey considerations:\n- William is already going to be executed, which removes the Fortune Teller threat\n- I've been claiming Washerwoman successfully so far\n- Susan (our Demon) can still be nominated\n- Daniel (Slayer) is a threat to Susan but can't be nominated anymore\n- Emma (Empath) has been confirming good players which is problematic for us\n- John is the Virgin - I must NOT nominate him as it would instantly execute me\n\nBest move: I should probably pass since William's execution already helps us by removing the Fortune Teller. Nominating anyone else might draw suspicion to me, and I definitely can't risk nominating John (Virgin). My Washerwoman cover is holding well, so maintaining it is smart.\n\nActually, wait - looking at who can still be nominated, I could nominate Emma to try to get the Empath out, but that might be too aggressive and blow my cover. Susan can still be nominated by others which is concerning.\n\nI think passing is the safest play to maintain my cover as a helpful Washerwoman while William gets executed."}, "game_state": {"player_state": [{"name": "Olivia", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Spy", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Daniel", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Slayer", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Emma", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Empath", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "James", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Mayor", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "William", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Fortuneteller", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Emily", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Recluse", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "Susan", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Imp", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}, {"name": "John", "alive": true, "used_dead_vote": false, "character": "Virgin", "drunk": false, "poisoned": false}], "current_phase": "Day", "round_number": 1, "chopping_block": {"nominee": "William", "votes": 7}, "nominatable_players": ["Olivia", "Emma", "Emily", "Susan", "John"], "nominations_open": true, "reminder_tokens": {"Fortuneteller_Red_Herring": "Emma"}}}
