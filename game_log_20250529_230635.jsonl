Susan emerges as a prime suspect, given Emma's Empath claim and her potentially deceptive Chef information. Her strategic positioning and the ambiguous claims from James and William make her a compelling target. I'm leaning towards using my Slayer power on Susan, but the risk of a mistaken shot looms large. Precision is crucial in this moment of potential game-changing decision.\n\nThe strategic approach demands careful coordination.

Emma is currently nominated with 5 votes and will be executed unless someone else gets more votes.\n2. Emma claims to be the Empath and says both Susan and Olivia are Evil.\n3.

The most I could do is send a message to clarify my thoughts for the remaining players.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. Emma's Empath claim that Susan and Olivia are both Evil would mean:\n- Susan is Evil (explains my Demon ping)\n- Olivia is Evil \n- That would be 2 Evil players, and with Emma potentially being Baron (making 3 Evil total), the Evil team would be Susan, Olivia, and Emma\n\nBut Emma is trying to get Susan and Olivia executed, which doesn't make sense if they're all on the same Evil team. \n\nHer claim seems potentially genuine.

Olivia now claims Monk, says she protected Susan night 1\n\nThe vote pattern:\n- Olivia voted YES to execute William\n- James voted YES to execute William\n\nThis is concerning because if William is Good (which my analysis suggests), then having both Olivia and James vote to execute him suggests they might be Evil trying to eliminate a Good player.\n\nLet me think about the teams:\n- If Emma was Baron (Minion) as suggested by James's info being accurate about her\n- If Susan and Olivia are both Evil as Emma claimed with her dying Empath info\n- Then William would be Good (Fortune Teller)\n- And I'm Good (Slayer)\n\nBut wait - James voted YES to execute William. James claimed Investigator and gave helpful info. If James was Good, why would he vote to execute William who seems Good?\n\nActually, let me reconsider. James is dead - he died night 2. The fact that he died right after being in William's Fortune Teller check is suspicious of William potentially being Evil and killing James to make it look like James was killed for being in his check.\n \nEmma's Empath claim about Evil neighbors and William's Fortune Teller results both point strongly to Susan being Evil. My decision carries significant weight - a wrong choice could hand victory to the Evil team. The vote seems designed to eliminate a potentially Good player, which raises red flags about Olivia and James's true allegiances. I need to carefully weigh the potential outcomes of my YES or NO vote, considering the risk of losing a Good player versus potentially removing an Evil team member.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'll protect William. The voting pattern seems suspicious, and eliminating a potentially Good Fortune Teller could critically weaken our team's information gathering. My instinct suggests preserving William's potential role is more strategic than risking his loss."}, "game_state": {}}

With 4 living players (Olivia, Daniel, Susan, me), we need 2 votes to execute, so I'm already at the threshold to be executed if I vote YES or abstain.\n\nMy Fortune Teller information:\n- Round 1: Susan+Emma = \"Yes, one is Demon\" \n- Round 2: Susan+James = \"Yes, one is Demon\"\n\nSusan appeared in both checks, and James died the night after being in my second check. This strongly suggests Susan is the Demon.\n\nEmma's dying Empath claim was that Susan and Olivia are both Evil neighbors. This aligns with my Susan being Demon theory.\n\nHowever, I'm being accused of being Evil and manipulating information. The votes against me suggest:\n1. Olivia claims to be Monk and protected Susan night 1, so trusts Susan\n2. James finds my pattern suspicious and died after my check\n3. Daniel believes my information and thinks Susan is Evil\n\nIf I vote NO (which is typical for a nominee), the vote fails since it would be 2 YES, 2 NO. This means no execution today.\n\nBut with only 4 players alive, if 2 are Evil (Susan as Demon, potentially Olivia as Minion based on Emma's claim), then Evil wins if they get one more death. \n\nThe key question: Am I actually the Fortune Teller getting real information, or am I Evil pretending to be Fortune Teller?\n\nI know I'm the real Fortune Teller and my information points to Susan being the Demon. \n\nJames's death immediately following our shared check implies Susan eliminated him to neutralize a potential threat. Strategically, my survival is crucial for revealing the truth about Susan's demonic nature. Voting NO preserves my ability to provide critical information and prevents Evil from gaining an immediate advantage by removing a Good player.\n\nDaniel's support validates my perspective, reinforcing the importance of protecting my role and continuing to expose Susan's potential threat to the team."}, "game_state": {}}

Current vote situation:\n   - Daniel is nominated with 2 votes (would be executed if nobody else gets more)\n   - Olivia is now nominated and needs 3 votes to execute, or 2+ to tie Daniel\n   - We need to save Daniel since he appears to be confirmed Good\n   - With 4 players alive, if 2 are Evil, Evil wins if one more Good player dies\n\n8. Strategic considerations:\n   - Daniel appears confirmed Good through James's Baron info\n   - Emma's Empath claim suggests both Susan and Olivia are Evil\n   - My Fortune Teller consistently pointed to Susan\n   - If Emma's info is right, executing either Susan or Olivia would hit Evil\n   \nI'll strategically vote to protect Daniel. My Fortune Teller checks consistently point to Susan as the Demon, and Emma's Empath claim supports targeting either Susan or Olivia.

Nominate someone new who hasn't been nominated yet (only James and Emma are left, but they're dead)\n2. Pass and let the day end with no execution\n3. Actually, wait - let me check who can be nominated: \"Players who can currently be nominated: James, Emma\"\n\nSince James and Emma are dead ghosts, I could nominate one of them. But that seems like a waste.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the voting patterns, if I can get William executed, that removes a major threat (Fortune Teller). The votes were:\n- William vs Susan: tied 3-3\n- Daniel vs Olivia: tied 2-2\n\nIf I nominate William again, I need to get more than 3 votes to exceed the previous tie. With James and Emma having used their ghost votes, only Olivia, Daniel, William, and Susan can vote. That's 4 total votes available.\n \nI've discovered a critical loophole in the nomination rules. Since all living players have already been nominated, the only remaining options are the dead players James and Emma. This works perfectly for my Evil strategy. The good team is completely blocked from making another nomination, which means if I nominate a dead player, the day will end without an execution. \n\nMy plan is now clear: nominate a dead player to force a no-execution day. This sets up my night kill, bringing us one step closer to victory.

Susan will definitely vote YES since she nominated me.\n\nActually wait - let me reread the voting order. It says \"Previous votes in this nomination: Olivia: Yes, James: Can't vote\". That means Olivia and James have already voted. The next voter should be me (Daniel), then Susan, then William (but William is dead), then Emma (but Emma is dead).\n \nMy survival hinges on a slim chance. With Olivia's YES vote already in play, Susan's upcoming vote is critical. If I vote NO, I'm gambling on Susan unexpectedly not supporting her own nomination.

Pass - this could lead to no execution if no one else nominates\n2. Send a message - try to coordinate with Olivia or confuse the situation\n3. Use slayer power - but I'm not the Slayer, I'm the Imp\n \nI'm contemplating a strategic move to create confusion. Nominating Olivia could make it appear like I'm genuinely trying to eliminate my teammate, potentially deceiving Daniel.
